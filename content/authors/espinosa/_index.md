I am a **computer scientist** specialized in the domains of **databases & distributed systems**. My core experience concerns {{<hl>}}**cloud & service based Big Data management & processing**{{</hl>}}.

I work as postdoctoral researcher at [University of Lyon](http://univ-lyon3.fr/). I am also researcher at the [ERIC](https://eric.msh-lse.fr/en/) research lab, and associate researcher at the French-Mexican [LAFMIA](http://lafmia.imag.fr) lab. I am also former researcher of the [Barcelona Supercomputing Centre](http://bsc.es), [TU Delft](http://tudelft.nl) and the [Grenoble Informatics Laboratory](http://liglab.fr/en).

I am fellow of the Mexican [AMEXCOMP](http://amexcomp.org.mx/) and [SNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistema_Nacional_de_Investigadores) (level C), and member of the [ACM](http://acm.org).
